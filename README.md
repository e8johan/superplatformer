# Introduction

This is the Super Platformer - a Godot game made by me and my kids.

# Todo

I want to get the following done (in no particular order):

- Enemies should sense the edge of platforms and not fall off
- Enimies should kill the player
- The player should be able to stomp (some) enimies
- There should be an android soft joystick overlay
- There should be treasures
- There should be coloured keys
- The player should be animated
- The enimies should be animated
- Multiple levels, menues, points and such
